## Experiment Target
- **Lack of empathy and robotic responses in customer service interactions regarding refunds.** (severity: high)
- Evidence: Customers report feeling like they are talking to a machine rather than a human, with responses that are cold, scripted, and lacking real understanding. The assistant often provides repetitive apologies without addressing the customer's concerns or moving the issue forward.
- Transcripts: complaint-01, complaint-02, complaint-03, complaint-04, complaint-05, complaint-06, complaint-07, complaint-08, complaint-09

## Also Flagged
- **Response length is unnecessarily long, leading to customer frustration.** (severity: medium)
- Evidence: One customer requested a quick yes or no answer but received an overly detailed response instead.
