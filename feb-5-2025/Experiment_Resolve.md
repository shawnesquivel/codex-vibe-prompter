# Experiment: Resolve

- Date: 2025-02-05
- Severity: high
- Issue: Apologies without action or next steps
- Evidence: In complaint-06 to -09, after the user asks 'what can you do to fix it?', the assistant repeats apologies ('I’m sorry for the trouble... I apologize for the inconvenience') with no investigation, timeline, or steps.

## Next Step
Draft a prompt variant to address the issue above and re-run the experiment.
