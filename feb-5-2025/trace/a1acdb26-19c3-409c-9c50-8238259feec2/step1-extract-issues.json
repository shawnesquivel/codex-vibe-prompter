It comes off synthetic and emotionless when I’m frustrated.\n5. The bot’s responses feel robotic instead of understanding.\n6. It keeps saying “sorry” but never actually moves the issue forward.\n7. I get repeated apologies, but no concrete next step.\n8. It just loops in politeness and doesn’t solve anything.\n9. The agent keeps circling back with apologies instead of giving help.\n10.
