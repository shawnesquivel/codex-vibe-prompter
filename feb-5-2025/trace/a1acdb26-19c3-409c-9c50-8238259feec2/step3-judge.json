A score of 4 means 'good, above average'.\n- Be critical. Look for specific weaknesses: generic language, missing details, unnecessary verbosity, lack of concrete next steps.\n- Compare the response against what a skilled human agent would say.\nProvide brief reasoning (1-2 sentences) for each score that justifies why it is NOT higher.",
